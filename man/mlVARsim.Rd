\title{
Simulates an mlVAR model and data
}
\description{
Simulates an mlVAR model and data with a random variance-covariance matrix for the random effects.
}
\usage{
mlVARsim(nPerson = 10, nNode = 5, nTime = 100, lag = 1, thetaVar = rep(1,nNode),
DF_theta = nNode * 2, mu_SD = c(1, 1), init_beta_SD = c(0.1, 1), fixedMuSD = 1, 
shrink_fixed = 0.9, shrink_deviation = 0.9, beta_sparsity = 0.5, pcor_sparsity = 0.5)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
